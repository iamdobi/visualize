## v0.3.0 — Eval Maturity

### Added
- 39 eval rounds completed (R1–R39, 8.1 avg score at R39)
- Carousel card types: Instagram/LinkedIn-format multi-slide carousels
- New visualization types: event poster, quote card, process guide, status report

### Changed
- Class-based theming (`html.theme-dark` / `html.theme-light`); removed `@media prefers-color-scheme`
- `var` for all top-level JS declarations to prevent TDZ errors
- Improved Chart.js integration: `Chart.defaults.animation = false`, destroy-and-recreate on theme toggle
- Theme-aware slide gradients using `color-mix()`
- Refactored to Claude Code plugin structure with `plugin.json` and marketplace support
